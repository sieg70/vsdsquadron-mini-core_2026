  A firmware library is a collection of reusable functions that provide a clean interface to hardware.

# Why APIs are important in embedded systems?
In industry:
- firmware is reused across projects
- hardware may change, APIs should not
- clear APIs reduce bugs and development time
  
# What was understood from the lab code?
